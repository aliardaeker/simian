# Purpose: PDES Engine in CPython and PyPy, mirroring most of the original LuaJIT version of Simian JIT-PDES
# NOTE: If speed rivaling C/C++ PDES engines is desired, consider adopting the LuaJIT version of Simian JIT-PDES

# NOTE: 5/9/2020: Changes: Nandakishore Santhi
# Simian for Python 3.7
# Combined all Simian modules into a single standalone module file
# Updated LICENSE and COPYRIGHT notices
