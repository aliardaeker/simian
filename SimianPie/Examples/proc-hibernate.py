# POC: Stephan Eidenbenz, eidenben@lanl.gov
# Date: March 25, 2015
# Copyright: Open source, must acknowledge original author
# Purpose: PDES Engine in CPython and PyPy, mirroring most of the original LuaJIT version of Simian JIT-PDES
# NOTE: If speed rivaling C/C++ PDES engines is desired, consider adopting the LuaJIT version of Simian JIT-PDES
#

# Changelog:
#
# NOTE: 5/9/2020: Changes: Nandakishore Santhi
# Simian for Python 3.7
# Combined all Simian modules into a single standalone module file
# Updated LICENSE and COPYRIGHT notices
